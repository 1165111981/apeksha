**Execution of the Task 4**

**Use the following instructions to get the gtkwave window**


To inspect the folder contents, use the command "ls." For simulating the Verilog code and checking errors, use the command "iverilog apeksha.v apeksha_tb.v."


./a.out - to get the output and make vcd file to be ready open

**Before proceeding with the execution of the instructions, let's take a moment to understand some parts of a Verilog code.**

**The code is structured systematically, with distinct sections broken down into separate parts**

1. Instruction Fetch Stage

2. Contents of registers and registers used

3. Instructions Hardcoded

**Lets move on to the execution Stage with Waveforms obtained for running the gtkwave apeksha.vcd**


1. When instantiated module is selected we get all the registers and wires as shown in the below figure

2. After adding a few signals, the waveform can be observed as depicted in the figure below.
